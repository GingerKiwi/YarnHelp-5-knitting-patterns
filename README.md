# Yarn Help! 5.0 Knitting Patterns app

This is part of the 5th complete redesign of Yarn Help!. The new version of Yarn Help! will be a multi-app site with each app hosted on a subdomain. 

Knitting patterns is a notion.so and Next.js app with 15 patterns for both beginner and experienced knitters. Beginners can follow along in sequence as each pattern builds on many of the skills learned in the previous ones. Experienced knitters can use the patterns as basic recipes as a starting point to design their own projects.

These are patterns that I keep using when I teach new knitters, when I want to knit something quickly, or as starting points when I'm designing my own projects.
